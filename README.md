# Description #
This application was created to erase all viruses and malwares from the USB flash drives and restore hidden personal data.  

In my university years mostly all computers in classrooms had worms that kept spreading through USB Flash drives specifically via Windows OS, where the virus hides all USB Flash Drive's all files into a hidden folder and replaces files with a fake _Simbolic Links_ that spreads the worm when you double click on them.

# How to #

1. Copy **deattributo.bat** into a USB Flash drive's root (main) folder,
2. Insert the USB Flash drive into a PC with the Windows OS (2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10),
3. Double click on the **deattributo.bat** file and wait a while, files will be moved from the hidden folder to the root (main) folder,
4. Check your USB Flash drive and make sure that all files restored as expected.
